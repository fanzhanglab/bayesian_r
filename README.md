# bayesian_r

Getting started with [cmdstanr](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html).
CmdStanR is a lightweight interface to [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) for R users to do Bayesian statistical inference.

I successfully installed CmdStan to /Users/zhanfan/.cmdstan/cmdstan-2.29.2, and set CmdStan path to: /Users/zhanfan/.cmdstan/cmdstan-2.29.2

I also installed [rethinking](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking) which has many implemented packages for Bayesian models.
