# bayesian_r

Getting started with [cmdstanr](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html).
CmdStanR is a lightweight interface to [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) for R users to do Bayesian statistical inference.

I successfully installed CmdStan to /Users/zhanfan/.cmdstan/cmdstan-2.29.2, and set CmdStan path to: /Users/zhanfan/.cmdstan/cmdstan-2.29.2

I also installed [rethinking](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking) which has many implemented packages for Bayesian models.

I tested the Bayesian Zero inflated Possion modeling and the code is [here](https://github.com/fanzhanglab/bayesian_r/blob/main/zero_inflated_possion_bayesian.ipynb). We may consider generating some other Bayesian modeling and inference using `cmdstanr` in the future.
